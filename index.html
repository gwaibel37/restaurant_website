                <p>Absolutely Fantastic! I walked in, and I said Wow. What an amazing place. Not a single place like it. A lot of homeless. 
                    A lot of homeless though outside this beautiful establishment, so many homeless. I said why are you here? They said they were just looking for a meal. 
                    I bought them an icecream cone then called ICE. No biggie though. I got their coffee and it was black. I said I like my coffee black, and the casheer was suprised. 
                    She said "wow, you like your coffee black?" I never put sugar in my coffee, its fake news. Fake news folks. Those people from CNN love to spread lies that 
                    I put sugar in my coffee. Can you believe it folks? Could someone who puts sugar in their coffee be this good at golf? I think not. Joe probably puts sugar in his 
                    coffee thats why his hands shake so much. So much folks. Quite frankly its why he fell down. Crooked Hillary puts sugar in her coffee. Gavin Newscum, probably 
                    puts a whole cube in there. I said how about some whipped cream and butter? Butter in coffee, its so good. So good. Quite frankly everyone knocks it before they try it. 
                    Its because I said it, and those fact-checkers at snopes, I call them dopes, but they spread lies and say its disgusting. Everyone raves about it. 
                    Almost as much as Trump tower. Love this place though. Still deserves 4.5 stars. MJGA.  - Fronald Frump</p>
                <p>The meeting rooms were perfect for small conferences. The area was peaceful, and the people were very nice. There were no couches though. - DJ Pance</p>
                <p>The breakfast in bed options were amazing, I sat in bed all morning! I also saw a school bus, and who doesnt love a yellow school bus? - Mamala Barris</p>
